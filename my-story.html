                    More than 30 years ago, I entered the hospitality industry.
                    I’m a world traveler at heart and satisfied my wanderlust
                    desires by cooking all over the US, in addition to studying
                    culinary arts, at the Culinary Institute of America. I make
                    it my mission to connect people with the fascinating world
                    of food! Throughout my journey I’ve had the opportunity to
                    work with some of the most legendary chefs and restaurants,
                    including Emeril Lagasse at Commander’s Palace, Jeremiah
                    Tower at Stars, Todd English at Olives and Paul Bertolli at
                    Oliveto.

                    Seeking a deeper connection to the food of my forefathers, I
                    spent five years in my ancestral home of Italy, immersing
                    myself in its multifaceted regions with work experiences in
                    over twenty restaurants. Most notably, I became executive
                    chef and partner at Venice’s internationally celebrated
                    Ristorante al Covo for several years. While in the mother
                    country, I was fortunate to strike up a friendship with
                    Carlo Petrini, the president of Slow Food, an organization
                    dedicated to preserving and passing down age-old culinary
                    practices.

                    Having ultimately settled in the US, I opened the first
                    serious regional Italian restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip
                    (Onda at the Mirage) and have gone on to create, own, and
                    manage concepts with prestigious hospitality partners
                    including The Borgata Hotel Atlantic City, Caesars
                    Entertainment, Harrah’s, Revel Casino, Isle of Capri Biloxi,
                    and Pompano Beach. In Las Vegas, I have worked with Clique
                    Hospitality, Red Rock Casino and Wynn Resorts. before moving
                    on to develop Meta-Hospitality projects and collaborate with
                    Yaamava at San Manuel, The Palms, and other national casino
                    partners.
